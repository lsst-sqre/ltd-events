LSST the Docs integration with SQuaRE Events (Kafka) on the `Roundtable <https://roundtable.lsst.io>`_ platform.
LTD Events receives events from `LTD Keeper <https://ltd-keeper.lsst.io>`__ at its ``/webhook`` endpoint and forwards those events to SQuaRE Events using the ``ltd.events`` Kafka topic.

ltd-events is developed with the `Safir <https://safir.lsst.io>`__ framework.
